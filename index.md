I'm Dilek. I am a native Turkish speaker based in Germany, 
with experience in localization and translation of material from 
English into Turkish.

My background is in (language) teaching education, and in the past
I have worked as an interpreter (English – Turkish – German), started as a
side project [Vocabzine][1], an online dictionary (English – Turkish) via Instagram,
and more recently I'm helping [open source projects][2] localize their content
into Turkish. I have also been involved in [international][3] [volunteer][4]
programs as interpreter.
