title = "Sunday Project—Pushing Symfony's Turkish Translation Status to 100%"
---

Last Sunday, with the help of my husband, I discovered [Symfony][1] on GitHub, 
and found out that the Turkish translations for the Validator component were 
not complete (they [stood][2] at 97%). I forked the repository, cloned it, and 
learnt how to use PhpStorm to add the missing translations. 

At the end I submitted a pull request. It was quite a fun trip.
Well, this morning, I woke up with an email notification from GitHub. 
It said that my PR was merged by [Fabien Potencier][3], the CEO of Symfony!

Happy Monday!
